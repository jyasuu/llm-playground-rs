# âœ… MCP Client Implementation Complete

## Implementation Summary

I have successfully implemented MCP (Model Context Protocol) client functionality that integrates MCP servers as built-in function tools in the LLM Playground.

### What was implemented:

1. **Core MCP Client** (`src/llm_playground/mcp_client.rs`)
   - HTTP-based MCP client for WASM environment
   - Server configuration management
   - Tool discovery and execution
   - Authentication support

2. **Type System Integration** (`src/llm_playground/types.rs`)
   - Added `McpConfig` to `ApiConfig`
   - Methods for managing MCP tools
   - Integration with existing function tools

3. **Built-in Tools Integration** (`src/llm_playground/builtin_tools.rs`)
   - Updated `execute_builtin_tool` to handle MCP tools
   - Automatic routing for `mcp_` prefixed tools

4. **UI Components** (`src/llm_playground/components/mcp_settings_panel.rs`)
   - Settings panel for managing MCP servers
   - Add/remove/configure servers
   - Connection status monitoring

5. **Documentation & Examples**
   - Complete integration guide (`MCP_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md`)
   - Working examples (`src/llm_playground/examples/mcp_integration_example.rs`)

### Default MCP Server Configuration:
```json
{
  "servers": {
    "github": {
      "name": "GitHub Copilot MCP",
      "type": "http",
      "url": "https://api.githubcopilot.com/mcp/",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_TOKEN_HERE"
      },
      "enabled": false
    }
  }
}
```

### Usage:
1. Configure MCP servers in the settings panel
2. Connect to discover available tools
3. MCP tools appear as function tools with `mcp_` prefix
4. Tools are automatically available to the LLM

### Next Steps:
- Configure your MCP server credentials
- Test with real MCP servers
- Add more MCP server configurations as needed

See `MCP_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md` for detailed usage instructions.
