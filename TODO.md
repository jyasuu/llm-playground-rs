# ✅ COMPLETED: Decoupled user submit message and llm client send message

## Solution Implemented: Event-Driven Architecture with Message Flow System

### 📁 Files Created:
1. **`src/llm_playground/message_flow.rs`** - Core event bus and coordinator
2. **`src/llm_playground/message_handlers.rs`** - Specialized event handlers  
3. **`src/llm_playground/flexible_playground_refactored.rs`** - Refactored playground component
4. **`DECOUPLING_SOLUTION.md`** - Complete documentation and migration guide

### 🔧 Key Improvements:
- **Event Bus Pattern**: Clean separation of concerns using MessageFlowEvent enum
- **Simplified UI**: Send message callback reduced from 300+ lines to ~10 lines
- **Automatic Loop Handling**: Function call loops handled automatically through events
- **Better Error Handling**: Centralized error management with retry logic
- **Highly Testable**: Each component can be tested independently
- **Easy to Extend**: New features can be added as new event handlers

### 🎯 Flow Implementation:
```
User Input → UserMessageSubmitted Event → LLMCallRequested → 
LLMCallCompleted → FunctionCallRequested → FunctionCallCompleted → 
FunctionCallBatchCompleted → Loop continues until no more function calls
```

### 📋 Next Steps:
1. Review the implementation in `flexible_playground_refactored.rs`
2. Test the new event-driven system
3. Replace the original implementation when ready
4. See `DECOUPLING_SOLUTION.md` for detailed migration guide
